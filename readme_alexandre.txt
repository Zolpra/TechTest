Here is my first android application !

Initialization of the app:

Being my first app, I noticed that some phone models cut the app when emulating.
This is why I advise you to use the model "Pixel_3a_API_30_x86"

When initializing the app, a dataset is created.
The list visible on the application contains only strings, which are retrieved thanks to a method of the Product class (the product objects contain the GTIN and DLC information specific to each one)

Possible areas for improvement:

Add product names / pictures using a pop-up when the product does not exist when adding the GTIN and DLC.
